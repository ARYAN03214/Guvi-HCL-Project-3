üìà Predictive Modeling of Stock Market Trends
‚úÖ Overview

This project aims to predict the next day stock closing price trend (Up/Down) for Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical stock market data. The problem is modeled as a binary classification task where the model predicts:

1 ‚Üí Next day closing price goes up

0 ‚Üí Next day closing price stays the same or goes down

‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure & Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Definition & Understanding

Objective: Predict the next day stock closing price trend using historical stock data.

Time-series data makes this a classification problem focused on trend prediction.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Cleaning

Historical stock data for AAPL is collected from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library.

Data is checked for missing/null values and cleaned as needed.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis & Visualization

Initial exploration: Display first few rows of the dataset.

Visualizations include:

Closing price history plot

Distribution plot of daily returns (to understand volatility)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering & Model Building

Target variable:

1 if next day's closing price > current day's closing price

0 otherwise

Features used:

Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Moving averages (5-day and 10-day)

Data Split:

Training (70%) and Testing (30%) without shuffling to preserve time order.

Features scaled using StandardScaler.

Model:

Random Forest Classifier trained on scaled training data.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

Predictions generated on the test set.

Performance metrics:

Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Confusion matrix (heatmap visualization)

Accuracy score

Feature importance bar plot

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

The dataset is time-series, so the train-test split avoids shuffling to maintain temporal order.

The model predicts the direction of price movement, not the exact future price.

Stock market prediction is inherently noisy and uncertain; interpret results cautiously.

This is a baseline model and can be further improved by experimenting with algorithms and features.
