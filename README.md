## Predictive Modeling of Stock Market Trends
Overview
This project aims to predict the next day stock closing price trend (Up/Down) for Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical stock market data. The problem is formulated as a binary classification task where the model predicts whether the closing price will go up (1) or stay the same/go down (0) the next day.

Project Structure & Steps
1.Problem Definition & Understanding

Objective: Predict next day stock closing price trend using historical data.
Stock market data is time-series data; trend prediction is a classification problem.
2.Data Collection & Cleaning

Historical stock data for Apple (AAPL) is downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
Data is checked for null values and cleaned accordingly.
3.Data Analysis & Visualization

Initial data exploration by printing the first few rows.
Visualization of closing price history to understand trends.
Distribution plot of daily returns to analyze volatility.
4.Feature Engineering & Model Building

Target variable defined as next day trend: 1 if next day closing price is higher, else 0.
Features include Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and moving averages (5-day and 10-day).
Data is split into training and testing sets (70:30) without shuffling to preserve time order.
Features are scaled using StandardScaler.
A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the scaled training data.
5.Model Evaluation

Predictions are made on the test set.
Performance is evaluated using classification report and confusion matrix.
Accuracy and feature importance are calculated and visualized.
6.Results & Insights

The model achieves reasonable accuracy, indicating that predicting stock price movement is challenging but feasible.
Moving averages and volume are identified as important features for trend prediction.
7.Future Work

Incorporate more advanced models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) or XGBoost.
Include additional features like news sentiment, technical indicators, and macroeconomic data.
Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for improved performance.

Notes
The dataset is time-series; hence, the train-test split is done without shuffling to maintain temporal order.
The model predicts the direction of price movement, not the exact price.
Stock market prediction is inherently noisy and uncertain; results should be interpreted with caution.
This is a baseline model; further improvements can be made by experimenting with different algorithms and features.
